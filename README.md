# meowlang

Meowlang is an esoteric programming language designed for cats.

## Language Specification

### The Meow List

A valid Meowlang source code is simply a text representation of the Meow List.

The Meow List is a sequence of Meow elements.

Every Meow element contains zero or more Meow tokens. The number of Meow tokens
in a Meow element corresponds to a non-negative integer value, which is the
value of the Meow element.

A Meow element can be treated either as a Meow instruction or a Meow operand,
depending on the execution context:

* When a Meow element is treated as a Meow instruction, the value of the element
  is the opcode of the instruction.
* When a Meow element is treated as a Meow operand, the operand value is the
  value of the element.

In the Meowlang runtime, the Meow List is a read/write list, which is both the
list of Meow instructions, and the only in-memory data structure that Meow
instructions can access.

In other words, code is data and data is code.

### Meow Tokens

A Meow token is a cat cry in plain text. The following Meow tokens are valid and
interchangeable in the Meowlang source code.

* `Meow` in English
* `Miaou` in French
* `å–µ` in Chinese
* `Miao` in Chinese Pinyin

Meow tokens are case-insensitive. For example, `Meow`, `meow`, and `MEOW` are
the same things.

### The Default Text Representation

The default text representation of a Meowlang source code uses semicolon `";"`
to end every Meow element.

For example, the following code contains 4 Meow elements, whose values are 0, 1,
2, and 4.

```text
;
Meow;
Meow Meow;
Meow Meow Meow;
Meow Meow Meow Meow;
```

White spaces including `" "`, `"\t"` and `"\n"` are sued for formatting purposes
only, and will be ignored when the source code is executed. You may layout your
code in many different and interesting ways. For example, the following code is
an equivalent representation of the above code:

```text
; M e o w ; MeowMeow ; MeowMeowMeow ; MeowMeowMeowMeow ;
```

### The Simplified Text Representation

For debugging and serialization, a Meow source code can also be recorded as a
sequence of non-negative integer numbers, each number corresponding to the value
of a Meow element. For example:

```text
0
1
2
3
4
```

### The Meow Instruction Set

| Opcode | Name | Description | `IP` Operation |
|--------|------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | `RET` | Print an empty line `"\n"` to the output console. | `IP++` |
| 1 | `MEOW` | Print a cat emoji to the output console. | `IP++` |
| 2 | `PUSH` | Push `N` to the tail of the Meow List. | `IP += 2` |
| 3 | `POP` | Pop the tail element from the Meow List. | `IP++` |
| 4 | `LOAD` | Push the value of `E(N)` to the tail of the Meow List. | `IP += 2` |
| 5 | `SAVE` | Copy the value of the tail element to `E(N)`. | `IP += 2` |
| 6 | `ADD` | Add the values of the last two tail elements, pop them from the tail, then push the result to the tail. | `IP++` |
| 7 | `SUB` | Subtract the value of the last element from the value of the second to the last element, pop the last two tail elements from the tail, then push the result to the tail. If the result is negative, a zero is pushed to the tail. | `IP++` |
| 8 | `JE` | If the value of the tail element is zero, set `IP` to `N`. Otherwise, continue to execute the next instruction. The tail element is popped before jumping or continuing the execution. | `IP = (T == 0) ? N : IP + 1` |
| >=9 | `NOP` | No operation. | `IP++` |

* `IP`: The Instruction Pointer.
* `N`: The value of the next element.
* `E(N)`: The element indexed by the value of the next element.
* `T`: The value of the tail element.
